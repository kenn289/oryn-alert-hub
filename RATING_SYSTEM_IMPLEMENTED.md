# ⭐ TICKET RATING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED

## ✅ **Rating System Complete!**

I've implemented a comprehensive ticket rating system that allows users to rate their support tickets, which will calculate the customer rating shown in the Priority Support section.

## 🔧 **Features Implemented:**

### 1. **Rating API Endpoint** ✅
- **File**: `src/app/api/support/tickets/route.ts`
- **Method**: PUT `/api/support/tickets`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Accepts ticket ID, rating (1-5), and optional feedback
  - Updates ticket with rating and feedback
  - Validates rating range (1-5 stars)

### 2. **Rating Modal Component** ✅
- **File**: `src/components/TicketRatingModal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Interactive 5-star rating system
  - Optional feedback textarea
  - Professional modal design with backdrop blur
  - Toast notifications for success/error
  - Form validation

### 3. **Updated Support Stats** ✅
- **File**: `src/app/api/support/stats/route.ts`
- **Enhancement**: 
  - Calculates customer rating from ticket ratings
  - Filters tickets with valid ratings (1-5)
  - Rounds to 1 decimal place for accuracy
  - Shows "No ratings yet" when no ratings exist

### 4. **Enhanced Priority Support Component** ✅
- **File**: `src/components/PrioritySupport.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Shows "Rate" button for resolved tickets without ratings
  - Displays existing ratings with star visualization
  - Integrates with rating modal
  - Refreshes data after rating submission

### 5. **Updated Support Service** ✅
- **File**: `src/lib/support-service.ts`
- **Enhancement**:
  - Updated `rateTicket` method to use new API
  - Added feedback parameter support
  - Better error handling and validation

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### User Experience:
1. **User submits support ticket** → Ticket created
2. **Admin resolves ticket** → Status changes to "resolved"
3. **User sees "Rate" button** → For resolved tickets without ratings
4. **User clicks "Rate"** → Rating modal opens
5. **User selects rating (1-5 stars)** → Optional feedback
6. **User submits rating** → Rating saved to database
7. **Customer rating updates** → Real-time calculation

### Rating Calculation:
- **Formula**: Average of all ticket ratings (1-5 stars)
- **Display**: Rounded to 1 decimal place
- **Fallback**: "No ratings yet" when no ratings exist
- **Real-time**: Updates immediately after rating submission

## 📊 **Database Integration:**

### Support Tickets Table:
- ✅ `rating` field (INTEGER, 1-5)
- ✅ `feedback` field (TEXT, optional)
- ✅ Proper validation and constraints

### Stats Calculation:
- ✅ Filters tickets with valid ratings
- ✅ Calculates average rating
- ✅ Handles edge cases (no ratings)
- ✅ Real-time updates

## 🎨 **UI/UX Features:**

### Rating Modal:

- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Stars fill with color
- ✅ **Rating Descriptions**: Text feedback for each rating
- ✅ **Optional Feedback**: Textarea for additional comments
- ✅ **Professional Design**: Backdrop blur, theme colors

### Support Interface:
